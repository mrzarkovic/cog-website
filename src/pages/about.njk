                <p>
                    Cog is a simple, beginner-friendly reactive expression
                    library designed to provide a reactive programming
                    experience using plain HTML and vanilla JavaScript. It's an
                    excellent tool for learning because it combines the benefits
                    of both imperative and declarative programming styles.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Imperative programming is about writing code that describes
                    in detail the steps that the computer must take to
                    accomplish the goal. This is how JavaScript typically works.
                    In Cog, you use imperative programming when you define
                    functions and manipulate variables.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Declarative programming, on the other hand, is about writing
                    code that describes what you want to accomplish, without
                    necessarily detailing how. This is how HTML typically works.
                    In Cog, you use declarative programming when you write your
                    HTML templates.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By combining these two styles, Cog allows you to write
                    JavaScript that directly manipulates the state of your
                    application (imperative), and HTML that automatically
                    updates to reflect the current state of the application
                    (declarative). This combination makes your code easier to
                    understand and reason about.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Furthermore, Cog's simplicity and lack of dependencies make
                    it a great stepping stone to more complex libraries and
                    frameworks. It allows you to focus on learning the core
                    concepts of reactive programming without getting overwhelmed
                    by additional dependencies or complex tooling. All you need
                    is vanilla JavaScript.
                </p>
                <p>In summary, Cog is a great tool for learning because it:</p>
